## Microcontroller Selection

Main Microcontroller: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/STM32H533CET6/22519691

Aux Microcontroller: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nordic-semiconductor-asa/NRF52810-QCAA-R/13572776 (M4 + BLE)

USB to UART: FT230XQ

Battery charging: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX14748.pdf

Need better FTDI Chip support

OLED Display: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5228

Optionally add-on board: https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/l/lattice/ice40-ultraplus-fpga

## Issue

does the board need to in nature support oled display and how to configure two microcontroller boards
